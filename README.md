## Dependencies:
- ffmpeg

``` python muter_vo.py <survivor> ``` 
  
This will make a completely muted voice pack for that survivor.

``` python process_vo.py <survivor> ``` 
  
This will process the voice lines into being compatible with the default soundcache hence being able to be installed properly in a .vpk format.

**process_vo.py requires a complete voice pack with all the voicelines associated with that survivor present, so making a muted voice pack with muter_vo.py might be necessary.**

teengirl (zoey)  
namvet (bill)  
biker (francis)   
manager (louis)
