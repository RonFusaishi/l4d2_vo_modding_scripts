expected output:

teengirl (zoey) 
namvet (bill) 
biker (francis) 
manager (louis)
producer (rochelle)
gambler (nick)
mechanic (ellis)
coach (coach)

example:
python muter_vo.py teengirl
#This will make a completely muted zoey voice pack

python process_vo.py teengirl
#This will process zoey's voice pack into being able to be installed properly as .vpk format

#Disclaimer: compress_vo.py requires a complete voice pack with all the voicelines associated with zoey present, so making a complete muted voice pack is required.
